# NextAuth Session Undefined in Protected API Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using NextAuth.js with API routes: the session object is sometimes undefined even when the user is logged in and the route is protected.

## Problem

The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` to protect it, but the `session` object remains `null`, resulting in unauthorized access.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `authOptions` are correctly imported and configured, and that the API route correctly handles potential errors during session retrieval.  This is demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`.
